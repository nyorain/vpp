// This file, vk.xml, is the Vulkan API Registry. It is a critically important
// and normative part of the Vulkan Specification, including a canonical
// machine-readable definition of the API, parameter and member validation
// language incorporated into the Specification and reference pages, and other
// material which is registered by Khronos, such as tags used by extension and
// layer authors. The only authoritative version of vk.xml is the one
// maintained in the master branch of the Khronos Vulkan GitHub project.
