// This file, vk.xml, is the Vulkan API Registry. It is a critically important
// and normative part of the Vulkan Specification, including a canonical

// language incorporated into the Specification and reference pages, and other
// material which is registered by Khronos, such as tags used by extension and
// layer authors. The authoritative public version of vk.xml is maintained in
// the master branch of the Khronos Vulkan GitHub project. The authoritative
// private version is maintained in the 1.0 branch of the member gitlab server.
